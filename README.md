# üé® Icon Voter
### Live website: https://next-crud-gloyens.vercel.app

## What is this project?
I make icon packs over at [rhosgfx.itch.io](https://rhosgfx.itch.io), and this website exists to allow people to vote on which icons they'd like to see next. Users can filter based on whether the icon is done, not done or in progress.

Unfortunately it's just a proof of concept for now, as I'm using Vercel KV, which limits hobby plans to 3000 requests per day. Even while testing it's quite easy to hit the limit!

## Aim
My goal for this website was to explore a few of Vercel's new (at time of writing) features, **[Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4#server-actions-alpha)** and **[Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-storage)**, which works like **[Redis](https://redis.io/)** but is a bit more streamlined for the Vercel ecosystem. I've been working with Next 13 and deploying on Vercel quite a lot recently, and it's a great developer experience, so it was pretty exciting to see them come out with new backend technologies that would make that side of development a bit easier.

However, the mix of server-side and client-side rendering made developing this app quite a frustrating experience. Using KV as a database made server-side rendering necessary, but that meant that a couple of features that would have been simple with React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks were a lot more difficult to implement than they should have been (e.g. adding filters, or adding a cooldown period on the vote button). Normally I'd use Phantom's **[useLocalState](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phntms/use-local-state)** to sidestep this issue, but the package wasn't compatible with Next's experimental server actions.

Eventually I was able to achieve everything I wanted to using a weird mix of client components, server actions and cookies, but the big takeaway for me here was that sometimes Next just isn't the right tool for the job. 

In a similar vein, Vercel's KV only allows for 3000 requests per day, which I was able to hit fairly easily while developing and testing. It's convenient, but much more expensive than Redis, so I'll probably just use that going forward.

## How it works

This website uses Next 13 with Typescript and the /app router, hosted on Vercel. It uses Vercel KV to store data.

### ü§ñ Filters

Filters work through a context provider, which can be described as a file that wraps around the entire app, allowing the variables it holds to be used across all components. The catch is that it only works with *client* components - Next uses server components by default - but since both the filter and the items themselves are client components, it works fine.

I'd rather have rendered them at the level of the list which contains all the items, which would have made for cleaner code - and I may still refactor it - but this solution works well.

### üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Admin Panel

The authentication for this app doesn't need to be particularly robust, so it's about as simple as it can possibly be:
- The user enters their password at `/login`, which is stored at a cookie
- The page is redirected to `/admin`
- The `/admin` page checks the cookie against a hidden environment variable
- If they match, the admin content is rendered; otherwise access is denied.
This makes is laughably vulnerable to attackers, but breaking into the admin panel would not reveal any sensitive information. This app exists as proof of concept; the authentication is only present to prevent people I share the page with from messing with the data. In the future I will use a package like **[`next-auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-auth)**.

## Future Plans
Besides the issues below, there's a few things I want to do:
- [ ] Redesign the site's CSS so it looks a bit nicer
- [ ] Add functionality to allow users to request icons to be added to the list, to be approved or rejected later in the admin panel
- [ ] Consider adding a DDOS protection service like Cloudflare

### Known Issues
- Admin panel authentication not particularly secure; not a huge issue right now, but might be if I decide to launch it as a real app.
